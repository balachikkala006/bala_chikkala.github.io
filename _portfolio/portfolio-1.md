Employee attrition [Employee Attrition Project](https://github.com/balachikkala006/Employee-attrition)
 is a critical concern for businesses, impacting productivity and costs.

The goal is to help organizations proactively address retention strategies and improve overall employee engagement, reducing unwanted attrition rates.


This project focuses on analyzing a medical insurance  dataset to predict the charges billed to individuals based on factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region. By conducting a thorough exploration and visualization of the data, we uncover key trends and relationships. Machine learning models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest, are used to build predictive models that estimate medical expenses and identify the most important features driving these costs. This approach provides valuable insights into the factors influencing healthcare expenses.[Health Insurance Project](https://github.com/balachikkala006/Health-insurance)
